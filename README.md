Responsive Design: You likely gained experience in creating a design that looks good on various screen sizes, considering factors like layout, font sizes, and spacing.

Flexbox or Grid: Depending on your approach, you may have used CSS Flexbox or Grid to structure and align the page's content.

Semantic HTML: You hopefully used semantic HTML elements appropriately to structure the content for accessibility and SEO.
